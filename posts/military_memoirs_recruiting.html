            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>I began my journey of military service in the summer of 2001. Little did I know that in just a couple of months there would be an event that would speed up my entry into military service.</p>

            <h2>Main Content</h2>
            <p>I was working for a company called 'Invenstment Recovery.' It was July and I had worked my way up to working in all aspects of the business. My supervisor called me into his office shortly after I arived at work one day to let me know that I was chosen to be let go. I applied to several places with no prospect of being hired.</p>

            <p>I don't recall where I got the idea to go to the recruiting station. I had probably seen an advertisement on the TV. Whatever it was, it prompted me to go to the recruiting station in Waterville, ME. My goal was to sign up for the Air Force because it seemed like the easiest entry point. After speaking to the recruiter for just a short time, he informed me that I would need a high school diploma to even be considered for entry. I only had a GED. The Air Force recruiter suggested that I try the Marines or the Army.</p>

            <p>I went out of the Air Force recruiters office and headed back toward the enterance of the recruiting station where I had initially passed the Army recruiting office and walked in. The recruiter sat me down and said that I needed to take the ASVAB (Armed Forces Vocational Aptitude Battery) exam to see what jobs I would be qualified to perform. I scheduled the exam for the earliest that I could get and waited for my exam date to arive.</p>

            <p>I was the only one taking the exam that day. It did not take very long, I had not studied, and the questions seemed easy enough. The recruiter called me to let me know that my results were in a couple of days later and we scheduled to meet the next day. I wasn't hopeful and I didn't even have an idea of what I may want to do, but the recruiter let me know that I pretty much had my pick of jobs and he handed me booklet with all the possible jobs and their descriptions. I had no reason to pick the job I pick except for the fact that it interested me in the moment. 63W, Heavy Wheeled Vehicle Mechanic was the MOS (Military Ocupational Speciality) that I chose.</p>

            <p>The next thing on the agenda was going to MEPS (Military Entry Processing Station) which was in Portland, ME. My first time there was short because I did not meet the minimum weight requirements for entry. I weighed 109 lbs and I was required to weigh 112 lbs so I was sent back to my recruiter to figure out a plan to gain weight and schedule another trip to MEPS. Just a few days after my initial visit to MEPS, two airplanes hit the world trade towers in New York, NY.</p>

            <p>I was scheduled to go to MEPS again in February of 2002 but that was moved up to January of 2002. I was shipped to Portland with my bag of minimum essentials (socks, underwear, and a couple of outfits) in anticipation of passing weight requirements. I passed the weight requirements and the rest of the medical screenings. I was brought into a room with other recruits that were heading out to training as well where we were sworn in. After the Navy officer gave us the oath to recite, he gave us a command that I would later come to understand as At Ease. I had no idea what he was talking about in the moment and it caused quite a bit of laughter from every one in the room, including the new recruits.</p>

            <p>We were given our orders and plane tickets then put on a bus to the airport where we all went our seperate ways. I was headed to Fort Knox, KY for my BCT (Basic Combat Training).</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>I began my process of signing up for service before the attack of the world trade towers on 9/11/2001. My decision to join was not patriotic but rather an economic nececity. I was strugling to find work to support my son and wife. Military service was a guaranteed paychecks and healthcare for my family. At the end of the day, I did what I had to do for my family.</p>
