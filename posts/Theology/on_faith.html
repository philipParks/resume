            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>In legal contexts, "religious faith" often refers to a system of beliefs and practices held by an individual or group, typically (not necessarily) involving a relationship with a higher power or transcendent reality, and encompassing moral and ethical codes. It is not solely about theism (belief in a god, or god's) but can also encompass non-theistic beliefs, including atheism and agnosticism, if they meet certain criteria. The legal definition emphasizes the sincerity and coherence of these beliefs, rather than their truth or validity.</p>
            <p>Over time, the definition of faith has changed. I remember when the definition was a belief in something or someone with no evidence to support the belief. In any definition, there is a lack of evidence for the reasoning behind the belief. I believe in putting my faith in something or someone that has historical data that provides at least some sense of reliability in the thing or person.</p>
            <p>The most prevalent form of faith in the United States of America is Christian faith. Christian faith can be consistently described as a belief that Jesus is God incarnate, born of a virgin, sacrificed to forgive the sins of all mankind. These are three points of faith that Christians can agree upon (for the most part).</p>
            <p>There does not need to be any more evidence for this in the Christian faith than what is written in the New Testament of the Bible. I find it personally very difficult to put faith in a book that has multiple versions. I also find it difficult to place faith in words that have been passed verbally for centuries before ever being written down.</p>

            <h2>The Bible: The Word</h2>
            <p>It would be difficult for any Christian to contend with the fact that their faith and beliefs are based on the Bible. There are those who profess their faith is based on their feeling God/Jesus present in their hearts/lifes. This is why the legal definition includes emphasis on, "the sincerity and coherence of these beliefs, rather than their truth or validity." But there can't be any belief or faith without first hearing of God/Jesus and we get these stories from the Bible. This is why I place the basis of Christian faith in the Bible.</p>
            <p>Christian faith begins in believing that the Bible is the inspired word of God. It would have began as an inspired word passed along, not by writing, but by voice. Anyone who has ever played a game of telephone knows how reliable word of mouth can be. With this knowledge, the first actual point of faith that must be taken is that the spoken word did not get changed from the time of Adam to the time of Moses, roughly 2,400 years. This time line is simply for the sake of establishing a minimum timeline because there is some dispute as to wether or not Moses was the author of the first 5 books of the Bible.</p>

            <h2>The Bible: The Writtings</h2>
            <p>The next point of faith has to be in the dutiful safeguarding and copying of the written word from the time of Moses to current times, another 3,400 years. It's not that changes aren't allowed, but part of the faith is also in the fact that God is infalable, therefore changes would not be necessary. The faith must also be in the decisions of which books are truly the inspired word of God and which would not need to be carried forward as dutifully. There are several books mentioned in the books of the Kings (I Kings, II Kings), and of the Chronicles (I Chronicles, II Chronicles) that are not to be found anywhere today.</p>
            <p>Christians must have faith that the selected books were in fact inspired by God and that the others were not. They must have faith in the selection process of people who believed that the earth had a border, that the stars could fall from the sky, and that their thoughts came from the heart in their chest, not the brain in their heads. Books have been added and removed by several different sects of Christianity which begs the question, "who got it right?" In the end, faith prevails in the selection of one sects beliefs over the other, which, I contend, is nothing more than the personal bias of our nature and nurture.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>This is simply the way I look at Christian faith. I do not mean to imply anything by what I write, simply state my personal observations on what it takes to have Christian faith and propose that it is far too much for me to have faith in. I do not condemn those of faith, but I do condemn those who would profess that it takes more faith to be an Athiest than to be a Christian. An Athiest needs simply not believe, while a Christian must have faith in everything I have mentioned here, and more. I have never felt God at work in my soul, nor have I ever felt the Spirit of the Lord in any building I have ever been in. I have felt the general atmosphere of jubilation, and I believe there to be a more quantum explainatiion for the feelings that people describe while in those group settings. I believe that we have not yet begun to explore the true cause of most of these baser feelings and I also believe that there are those that understand it enough to take advantage of people who believe it to be God working on their soul, or the Spirit of the Lord.</p>
