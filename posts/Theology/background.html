            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>I was born to parents who were Baptist Christians. My Grandfather was a Baptist Minister, making my mother a pastor's daughter. Both my mother and father had ambitions of becoming Ministers that never came to fruition. Being born into the Christian church, I never had much dealings with the world outside of the church. My friends were all Christians, and all my parents' friends were Christians. I even received a Christian home schooling education.
            </p>

            <h2>Pre-Salvation</h2>
            <p>I can recall attending my grandfather's church, Hampden Baptist Church in Hampden, Maine, as far back as 1985 when I was 3 or 4 years old. I can still recall the smell of the old wooden church, the creaking of the wooden pews, the songs of the Hymnals, and the sound of the piano and organ playing.
            </p>

            <p>We would wake up before the sun came up on Sunday mornings to prepare for the car ride to church. My family was always one of the first to get to the church. My Aunt would be playing one of the hymns on the piano, and she would play hymns until my Grandfather began the service.</p>

            <p>The service would usually start with a prayer, leading into the congregation singing songs from the hymnal, a scripture reading, announcements, and usually a special song sung by one of the members of the church with the "gift" of song (usually my mother).</p>

            <p>Before my Grandfather would start the sermon, he would dismiss the children for Sunday School. My Grandmother was the Sunday School Teacher and would lead all the children (usually 16 and under) down to the basement of the church where there was a room set up with drawings of scenes from Bible stories on the wall and a flannel board where my Grandmother would play out scenes from the most popular Bible stories.</p>

            <h2>Salvation</h2>
            <p>There are 2 major events in every Christian's life: Salvation, which is the acceptance of Jesus Christ as your savior from your sins, and Baptism, which is the public display of the cleansing of sins. I never went through baptism because I had a fear of water from an incident when I was 2 years old. I went through the process of accepting Jesus Christ as my savior when I was around 5 years old.</p>

            <p>At the end of every sermon, the children who went to Sunday School would rejoin their parents. We would sing a few more songs, and then my Grandfather would have the congregation bow their heads and close their eyes and invite those who had not accepted Jesus Christ as their personal savior to raise their hand so that he could lead them in the prayer of salvation.</p>

            <p>I had been one of the ones who raised their hands, and my Grandfather took me aside after the final prayer and led me to his office, where he explained the process to me and led me in the prayer of salvation. The prayer of salvation varies but consists of an admission of being guilty of sin, a profession of the belief in Jesus Christ being God's son sent to earth as a human sacrifice for the sins of humanity, and an acceptance of Jesus Christ as your savior from your sins.</p>

            <h2>Being a Christian</h2>
            <p>I was deeply involved with the Christian church for my entire youth. I attended church every Sunday, Christian Bible Camps every summer, Vacation Bible School every spring, and participated in Youth Group. I was voted Youth Group President 2 years in a row. I was a member of the Pioneers, a church group of young men that was very much like the Boy Scouts. My mother took me to 4H events and used the Pace home education system to give me an education based on Christian values.</p>

            <p>I was oblivious of the dark side of the church until I attended a Christian School in Hartland, Maine. I was placed in a Christian School for High School because my mother had exhausted her knowledge of math and science and determined that she wanted me to be able to understand the subjects better than she did. I was disappointed by the lack of Christian love that I felt in this environment. It felt more like a prison than a school. I would hear the teachers gossiping about students and other teachers. I was finally introduced to the hypocrisy of the American Christian Church.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>I was raised as a member of the Christian religion. Christian values were a big part of my upbringing. When I discovered the hypocrisy of the Christian Church, I began to question what it even meant to be a Christian. When I started looking for answers from the people who seemed to be hypocrites, they would give me answers that were contradictory to everything I had been taught the Bible said about being a Christian. When I dug deep into the Bible to find the answers for myself, I discovered that most of my beliefs were based on legend rather than fact and that faith was a much larger part of the Christian religion than I had previously known.</p>

            <p>This is where I tell you that I have always struggled with faith. The definition of faith is belief in something without evidence. I recited different versions of the salvation prayer more times than I can count. I just didn't get it. I only trusted things that I could verify. I suppose it's safe to say that I was never a Christian, because I never had faith.</p>
