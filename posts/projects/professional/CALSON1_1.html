            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>I started at CALSON1 working at their retail location as a customer service representative. I was taking some business classes at the time and had a great deal of management experience from my time in the Army. The owners would ask the manager for daily sales numbers from time to time. It seemed random and I couldn't understand why they didn't just keep a spreadsheet of daily sales numbers. In some of my down time, I set up a spreadsheet for the manager where he could plug the daily sales numbers in so that he could reference them when the owners asked for them. The manager left soon after for personal reasons and a new manager was brought in.</p>

            <h2>Management</h2>
            <p>The new manager was hired for his educational background and working history with the owners. I spoke with the new manager and the owners about becoming a manager myself so that we could have a manager on every shift. I used my spreadsheets and management background to convince them that I was able to handle the responsibilities and could add value to the organization.</p>
            <p>Once we got the logistics of the organizational shift worked out, my fellow manager and I got to work on evaluating the state of the business. My fellow managers strength was in marketing and advertising, and my strengths were my organizational skills and management experience.</p>

            <h2>Business Evaluation</h2>
            <p>We began by going through the inventory system that was a part of the Point-of-Sale (POS) system that the owners used. The departments were thrown together and not very well distinguished. We began by diversifying the inventory departments to better represent the variety of products that the retail business offered. The first thing this improved was our ordering process because we aligned the departments with the departments of our wholesale suppliers, making it easier to navigate their catalogs.</p>
            <p>Once we had the inventory system set for better tracking of sales trends, we began to access the daily sales data from the POS. We expanded the spreadsheets to include daily sales information from 3 years prior up to the current daily numbers. Now, whenever the owners were asking for daily sales information, we had the answers readily available. We eventually started sending daily report emails that contained the information most frequently requested by the owners.</p>
            <p>Even before our evaluation, the business was growing. We knew that with a few operational and decision making changes we could make even more growth.</p>

            <h2>Data Collection Methods</h2>
            <p>Now that we had the departments sorted out and properly distinguished, I was able to draw historical sales data from the POS. I believe it important to mention that at this point, I had very little knowledge concerning data analysis. I took the department information and put it into a spreadhseet. I used the sales quantities to make a Power Points presentation using pie charts and bar graphs to visualize the product sales data that I had collected.</p>
            <p>The daily sales numbers that I had collected were turned into a line chart. I also grouped the daily sales data into quarterly sales numbers, and annual sales numbers.</p>
            <p>We were also able to gather customer sales information through a customer loyalty program that the ownerss had set up for customer rentention.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>This was my first post outlining my intent to continue to release regular content and updates on my programming progress.</p>
