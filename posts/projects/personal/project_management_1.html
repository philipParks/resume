            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>I have begun the paperwork for my first major personal project, a Project Management Application. I decided to make my first major project something that I would be able to use for the rest of my professional career. It will demonstrate my ability to follow the project management lifecycle along with the software development lifecycle.</p>

            <h2>Creation Phase</h2>
            <p>The creation phase of the project management lifecycle consists of forming a business plan. To put it simply, a business plan answers a business problem or question. The business problem I am addressing with this business plan is the need of a project management application. While there are many other competitors out there that can fit the bill, developing an internal solution to project management will not only give me a tool that I can use going forward, but will also allow be to demonstrate my ability to follow the project management, and software development lifecycle.</p>

            <h2>Initiation Phase</h2>
            <p>The initiation phase of the project management lifecycle consists of defining the goals of the project, identifying stakeholders, developing the business case, creating a project charter, and other administrative tasks. While many of these tasks are not necissarily needed when working on a project alone, I still created all the documentation for the initiation phase. This allows me to have a template for future projects and for reference as I am working on the content of the application.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>I plan on working on this project every Sunday for at least 2 hours. I have a tentative timeline and will be publishing the documentation during the respective phase of the project management lifecycle and according to my communication plan.</p>
