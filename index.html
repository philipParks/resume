                <!-- //  ABOUT ME  // -->
                <main>
                <p>I am an experienced problem solver with over 13 years of troubleshooting and leadership experience. Most of my experience comes from my time in the United States Army and has been enhanced since then through my experience as a data analyst and general manager in a small retail business. I most recently earned my Bachelor of Computer Science with a focus on Software Development from Western Goverenors University. The primary focus of my studies was the software development life cycle through the development of several Java applications using the JavaFX framework. These applications were used to interact with several databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, etc.) using JDBC.

                        This is my blog. an area where I discuss my experiences and beliefs. I do not have all the answers (nobody does), but if I can shed some light on a subject or help someone else in their struggle to understand this life, this area will have served it's purpose.
