        <p>
          I am a troubleshooter and problem solver. I enjoy working with people
          to find solutions to complex problems. While working with a small
          business to improve their processes, I discovered a skill/passion for
          data analysis while assisting them in setting up a data driven
          decision making process for their retail inventory. I look forward to
          using this new found skill to assist other companies in doing the
          same.

            <h3>Enginuity Inventory Control Application</h3>
            <p>
              This was my capstone project for my degree. It is an inventory
              control application for an engine rebuild company. It tracks
              engines and the parts needed to rebuild them.
            </p>
            <p>
              I used the JavaFX framework for this Java application along with
              mySQL for the database.
